    We are a group of professional brokers, who specialise on the trading of futures contracts on exchanges. In January 2020, an
    interesting situation developed in the world of oil market from our point of view. The essence of this situation was that the
    oil
    price dropped to negative values. In this regard, it was decided to purchase a significant amount of oil of the brand BRENT
    and WTI,
    which was done. We spent our personal funds and funds obtained from the purchase of oil on transportation to ports and on
    paying for
    loading and storing oil directly in the holds of tankers. Our decision was correct. It was decided not to sell oil right away,
    but to
    hold it until prices recover. We sold part of the oil to pay for storage services on tankers, but we decided to keep the bulk
    of it
    for a long time.
